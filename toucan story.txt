User 1: Story

Logged in on toucan and scrolled through the entries on the homepage. Looked at different topics. People and Communities I follow had several debates going on. Each entries had several participants. Some had videos and photos on their debates.
Each entries had shares, likes and participations underneath them.

There were options to view the most popular and trending topics in toucan. 

There was also a live feed of my friends activities. Jhon Doe applauded someone's argument, and Susan apparently switched sides. And Michael just started debating on a topic.

I had the option to search for any topic I wanted to participate in. I also could choose to create a new topic. My notification shows that I had 3 unread messages. I clicked on it, Someone had commented on my argument. And one of my arguments was applouded by 341 people. My opponent had replied to my argument.
